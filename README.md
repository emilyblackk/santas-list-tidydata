# santas-list-tidydata
Help Santa digitize his list in time for Christmas! 

Santa has contacted Emily and Jarrett at the Marshall lab, and asked for our help! He wants to get with the times and digitize his Christmas list, 
but he's not sure where to start. 

Emily and Jarrett will walk you through how to take some of Santa's data and make it "tidy", and how to work with many different data types!
Hope you enjoy!
